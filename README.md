# The Blockchain Hanky Code

In principle, a hanky worn on left means selling, while a worn on the right means buying.  In practice, either sides represents an interest, and thus maybe a swinger.

All hanky colors should be best approximations, as not everyone can find all colors, even if ebay or aliexpress likely do carry them all in bulk.  We do not have hanky codes for national currencies, as these should be implied by the country in which you're standing or where you live. 

### Suposidly decentralized

Bitcoin - Orange, for the usual bitcoin logo color.

Ethereum - Yellow, in honor of the Ethereum yellow papper.

Dogecoin - Doge-like tan colors, for Doge of course. 

ZCash - Black, for the dark net.

Monero - Grey, wannabe black.

Red - Mina.  It's founder Izaak Meckler is knowledgable and supportive of communism.  Also zk roll ups make sense for a communist economy too.

Polkadot - Ideally pink polkadots on a white hanky, but white on a pink hanky is fine too.  Wite with multi-color dots means wider polkadot ecosystem.  Any other polkadot pattern should ideally represent specific parachain projects, but if unclaimed then anything goes, well shared security brings trust.  Polakdot piovacy coins should favor black backgrounds.  Polkadot stable coins should favor green backgrounds. 

Cardano - White, for the Chinese rice farmers to whome Charles Hoskinson shills Cardano

Solana - Brown, for Anal OS, Solanus, etc.

Cosmos - Any star pattern really, but specific distinctive star patterns or stellar images should represent specific zones, ala Penumbra.  A star pattern should not be so regular it resmebles polakdots.  Images make sense because IBC being just a bridge makes trust hard.

Filecoin - ???

TRON - Mustard, for Ethereum plus braging

Litecoin - ???

DAI - ???

NEAR - ???

ICP - White and black Juggalo clown face pattern 


### Centralized ala exchange run

XRP - ???

USDT - Ideally US Dollargreen, meaning hex code #6B8068, or RGB values 107, 128, 104, or 32% red, 38% green, and 31% blue. 

USDC - ???

??? - Clown-ish colored light green. 

??? - Lime Green, for a real lemon of a stable coin.

BNB - ???

BUSD - ???

### Physical

Drugs - Ziploc bag, left buying, right selling ([cite](https://user.xmission.com/~trevin/hanky.html)).

Gold - Actual physical gold.  No blockchains can use gold hankies.
